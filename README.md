# Hello World in Swift

## Objectives

  1. Write valid code that prints "Hello, World!"
  2. Run the iOS project

## Outline

  * Set up Swift project with a single test that sees if the user prints
    "Hello, World"
  * Give them very very exact instructions to write `print("Hello, World")` in
    a function definition. We need to test it, so it needs to be in a function
    definition I'm pretty sure
  * Explain how to execute the file, tell them to watch out for the simulator
    starting up
  * See how to view test results
  * See how to see the actual output in the lldb output
